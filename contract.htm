<h1>Christopher Hahn WEB115 Course Contract</h1>

<p>I, Christopher Hahn agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2012 WEB115-85 Markup & Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
<p>Signed: Christopher Hahn, 08/11/2012</p>
